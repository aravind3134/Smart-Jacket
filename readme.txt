This repository would only contain the software required for the application as of now. The interface between the Raspberry Pi and the camera is to be included. 

The software would consist of the following:
1. The python code used for the creatipon of the model. 
2. The test code to load the model and the code to feed the image as an input for the application.
3. The training and testing images is included.

The interface code would be included later.
